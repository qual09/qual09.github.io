				My name is Anna Różańska. I am an <strong>IT specialist and
					consultant</strong>, currently working at Cisco Systems. I
				have chosen this profession because I believe that
				IT solutions may improve the way we live, work and
				learn. It is my mission to empower others on the
				way to achieving their goals. I have a clear, logical
				mind with a practical approach to problem-solving
				and a drive to see things through to completion. I
				am eager to be challenged in order to improve my
				IT and communication skills.
			</p>

			<h3>On a personal note:</h3>
			<p>
				I am passionate about <strong>travelling</strong> as I believe it is the
				best learning experience that a human can have. It
				forces us to go out of our comfort zones, meet other
				cultures and realize how diverse our world truly is.
				My experience after visiting few continents helped
				me to understand that my way of living is not the
				only valid one, and it may be valuable to observe
				and learn from others.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my most precious memories is climbing
				<strong>Kilimanjaro</strong> - the highest mountain of Africa. It
				taught me that it is possible to make our dreams/goals come true, even if sometimes it seems
				impossible. The most important is to plan it and then go forward, step by step.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have a medical background and working in a hospital was an amazing experience to me. It
				helped me to realize how essential taking care of our <strong>health</strong> is. I have also gained experience
				in working with people and understood how important teamwork is.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Freedom</strong> is another value I cherish, and I am a strong supporter of individual responsibility.
				We may have different circumstances, but in the end, it depends on us how we behave and
				what we contribute to this world.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love spending time with my <strong>closed ones</strong>, especially playing board/computer/RPG games.
				Reading books, performing creative tasks is also my thing.
